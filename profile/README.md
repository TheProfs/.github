## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You've reached the [Bitpaper][bitpaper] organisation, the collaborative whiteboard used by thousands of tutors worldwide.

Most of the work we do here is in private repositories but we frequently open-source our components; 
you can find a lot of them pinned in these pages. You are free to use them.

We [deploy daily][ci], structure our systems using the [Microservice Architecture][microservices], adhere to [12-factor][12-factors] principles and 
more often-than-not, [actually write tests][tdd].  

Most of our code is typed in [ES6][es6], written in a [functional prose][func-programming].

If you're interested in working with us, drop us an email at admin|at|bitpaper|dot|io

Best of luck,  
the [Bitpaper Team][bp-team] ðŸš€
